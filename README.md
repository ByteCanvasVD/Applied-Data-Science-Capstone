# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This repository contains code and resources for predicting the reuse of SpaceX Falcon 9's first stage using machine learning. It includes data collection from SpaceX’s API, exploratory data analysis, and a predictive model to estimate landing success and launch cost efficiency.
This repository contains the code and resources for the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch prediction project. The goal of this project is to analyze data from SpaceX and build a machine learning model to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land and be reused. By determining the likelihood of reuse, the project aims to estimate the cost efficiency of rocket launches.

Key aspects of the project include:

Data collection from SpaceX’s public API and web scraping.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand launch parameters.
SQL and Python integration for data querying.
Machine learning model development for first stage landing predictions.
Dashboard creation for data visualization and team reporting.
This project is part of my work as a data scientist at Space Y, a fictional rocket company aiming to compete with SpaceX.
